Elidel,Drugs.com,"After having eczema most of my life, it seemed to get worse after having allergy shots. 18 months ago the rash was on my face, neck, shoulders, back, and some on my stomach and legs. Hot sweaty weather was unbearable. I had 4 triamcinolone shots over 14 months. The shots cleared me up, but their good effect became less each time, and I had arm bruising and started to get anxiety episodes. A new doctor prescribed tacrolimus for my face, but I was allergic to it. Elidel is working for now, clearing angry red patches on the sides of my neck and most of the problems areas on my face, including my left eye. My arms also got better even though I only used Pimecrolimus on face and neck. However, I feel tired, sometimes bone tired. Twice in six weeks of use I have had swollen glands and a cold with a fatigue that keeps coming back. I pause the medication to get better.

Elidel,Drugs.com,"""Developed dermatitis around my eyes. Flare ups became more and more frequent and lasted longer each time. I didn't like the idea of putting cortisone on my eyelids for prolonged periods so did research on other safer alternatives.
 I've since switched to Elidel and it has completely cleared up the rash, no more itching, no redness and the damaged skin is finally getting a chance to heal.
 Used sparingly on my eyelids is enough to keep the dermatitis reappearing.
 It can dry the skin out but nowhere near as bad as cortisone. Counteract dryness with coconut oil which works better than commercial moisturisers for me.

It continued to burn and then on about day 6 I started noticing I was getting way more bumps and redness. Used it for a few more days thinking maybe it would eventually help before I realized the Elidel was actually causing the reaction. Within a few more days my face was red, covered in bumps, swollen, burning, itching...it was agony. And it kept spreading to all parts of my face (because I would put the Elidel on the lower part of my face in the morning then apply sunblock so it spread). I ended up having to take prednisone for 4 weeks.

BUT ( and BIG emphasis on this) it WORKS. In my experience overnight my flaking, swollen and sensitive skin looked soo much better. Part of why it burns so much is because your skin has open wounds, so over time as your skin heals, it gets A LOT more bearable. The first time I used this product I washed it off instantly and refused to use it because of the pain, but then the next time my eczema flared up I decided to try again. Give this product a chance and try to bear through it because in my experience it truly helps. Tips: I refrigerate eucrisa so that its cold and doesn't burn as much and I also got a eye mask that you put in the fridge and I put that on my eyes while they burn and the coolness helps.

However after 6 months I started getting horrible burning painful blotches on my neck at first. Then my face. Then my inner elbows. It hurt really bad that if I wore a long sleeve shirt to hide it, it would ache in pain. I decided to stop the drug as an experiment to see if it was caused by the drug.

After 3 months of stopping dupixent my skin went back to regular eczema that I was used to. I felt itchy again which was annoying but the horrible painful blotchy skin was gone on my face and neck.

Now, 2 months later, my bad condition still persists and I have developed seborrheic dermatitis, which I’ve never had before.

My eczema flare up covered my entire body which I've never experienced before. The side effects mentioned to me were itchy eyes, conjunctivitis, cold sores. I stopped the Dupixent in October of 2017; so I took it for about a 2 months, 4 injections in total. I decided to stop as I began to feel my lips forming a cold sore and my eyes were terribly itchy. While on Dupixent, the itch it caused my eyes was unbearable. In May of 2018, I visited my Ophthalmologist again because my vision was slowly getting worse. There, I was diagnosed with having Keratoconus which is a condition where the eye is no longer round but bulging. This was said to be caused by excessive rubbing of the eye. There is no cure for this eye condition just treatment.

Constant itching, threw away so many blood spotted shirts, couldn't wear short sleeves, everyone always thought I had poison ivy, couldn't sleep without heavy antihistamine which made me non-functional the next day. I was skeptical when my Dr mentioned this drug. I've used every lotion and potion on the market, the success stats weren't that impressive and giving myself a shot every 2 weeks sounded awful.

Dupixent,Drugs.com,I started dupixent mid February and by March my hair started falling out. I have always had thick curly hair and now my hair is so thin. I only took 4 shots and had to stop because of so much hair loss. Every time I wash my hair it’s falls out in clumps. My doctor says I have to wait until the drug is completely out of my system but I've been off for 3 weeks and my hair continues to fall out. I feel like suing the drUg company because there is no way they did not know this was a side effect. I wish I never started this drug. I’ve had eczema my whole life but the last couple of years have been the worst I’ve had it. It was taking over my life. My whole body and face was covered with oozing crusty eczema and had to call out of work for days . I was so depressed . I don’t want to go bald . I hope my hair stops falling out soon.

Elidel,WebMD,"I had severe eczema on my face, forehead, cheeks and eyebrows nearly all my life. I was ok at school, but when I hit college, the eczema just flared up and went totally out of control. It was so scaly and flaky and itchy on a daily basis that due to my constant scratching, I had no eyebrows left as they had fallen out. And my skin was so damaged that new eyebrows couldn't grow. My face was always red like I had severe sunburn. Mentally I was in a really bad place due to the eczema. I suffered with it really badly. Normal conventional facial medication prescribed by the GP did very little and sometimes it made the itching and scratching even worse. It was towards the end of 2003 that I accidently came across Elidel whilst reading a newspaper. There was an article in the newspaper on how well Elidel had helped someones young child that was suffering with severe eczema. I approached my GP and told him about it and said I would like to try it. He found and prescribed it for me. And that was just over 12 years ago. Just after a few weeks of using Elidel, my face actually started to heal. My skin tone changed and so did its texture. I just couldnt believe it. The colour actually came back to what it should have been originally, which was a colour which I had actually forgotten. Even in the early stages of using the medication, the results came quick and even the GP commented on how well my skin had improved. There was no more itching or the need and desire to scratch. It has totally eradicated the eczema and has been absolutely life changing. People wouldnnt even believe that I ever had eczema. Now in 2019 I just apply a few small dabs on my cheeks after showering. I dont ever need to apply any to my forehead. And after the application, I just apply some normal Vaseline intensive care.

Protopic,WebMD,"Long story short: I experienced very mild side effects only, and this has cleared my stubborn eczema that was no longer responding to hydrocortisone. 
 
 
 Long story: I mainly get eczema/AD around my eyes and mouth, have had this since I was 12, Iâ??m now 27, and about 3 years ago I started to get dyshydrotic eczema on my fingers. 
 I did an initial course of protopic 1% twice a day for 6 weeks, now using it twice a week (or less) for â??maintenanceâ?? around my eyes and mouth and on my fingers only, some eczema patches never returned after the initial 6 week treatment so I donâ??t use the protopic on those areas anymore, hopefully I can eventually stop completely. My fingers took the longest to clear and I still experience flares so I sometimes apply the protopic for a few days up to a week if itâ??s a bad one - Iâ??m pretty sure itâ??s allergies Iâ??m waiting for patch testing. 
 In terms of side effects, I did experience the burning/itching sensation, but it stopped after a week or so of use. Sometimes if I go a bit longer between maintenance applications I get the burning again a little bit. I also sometimes getting flushing and burning when I drink alcohol particularly around my eyes, it usually lasts 30 mins max and only happens if Iâ??ve applied the protopic within 48 hours before drinking. 
 
 I used to use hydrocortisone to treat my eczema, but about a year and a half ago my flares started occurring more often and the hydrocortisone seemed to have become less effective. My doctor told me to stop using it completely, that what I was getting was a rebound rash not eczema. I stopped, and so began the most hellish year of my life! The worst flares Iâ??ve ever experienced, couldnâ??t sleep with the itchiness, some areas were oozing, I didnâ??t want to leave the house because of how bad I felt I looked. I still donâ??t know if what I was experiencing was TSW (topical steroid withdrawal) or just my eczema worsening due to removal of treatment. Iâ??ve since learned that stopping it suddenly instead of tapering off was an horrible idea and increased chances of negative side effects so thank you doctor. Anyway with a lot of reluctance I eventually (about 4 months ago) gave in to a dermatologist and agreed to treatment with protopic. 
 I was reluctant because of the possibility that I was going through TSW, and through TSW Facebook groups I read that the same thing happens with protopic. 
 I still donâ??t know if I made the right choice for the long term, only time will tell (I used hydrocortisone intermittently for over 12 years before it stopped working), but it has been a huge relief the last few months to not obsess over my skin everyday and to have a break.","['long', 'story', 'short', 'experience', 'mild', 'effect', 'clear', 'stubborn', 'eczema', 'long', 'respond', 'hydrocortisone', '\n\n\n', 'long', 'story', 'mainly', 'eczema', 'ad', 'eye', 'mouth', '12', 'iâ\x80\x99m', '27', '3', 'year', 'ago', 'start', 'dyshydrotic', 'eczema', 'finger', '\n', 'initial', 'course', 'protopic', '1', 'twice', 'day', '6', 'week', 'twice', 'week', 'â\x80\x98maintenanceâ\x80\x99', 'eye', 'mouth', 'finger', 'eczema', 'patch', 'return', 'initial', '6', 'week', 'treatment', 'donâ\x80\x99t', 'use', 'protopic', 'area', 'anymore', 'hopefully', 'eventually', 'stop', 'completely', 'finger', 'take', 'long', 'clear', 'experience', 'flare', 'apply', 'protopic', 'day', 'week', 'itâ\x80\x99s', 'bad', 'iâ\x80\x99m', 'pretty', 'sure', 'itâ\x80\x99s', 'allergie', 'iâ\x80\x99m', 'wait', 'patch', 'testing', '\n', 'term', 'effect', 'experience', 'burning', 'itching', 'sensation', 'stop', 'week', 'use', 'bit', 'long', 'maintenance', 'application', 'burning', 'little', 'bit', 'getting', 'flush', 'burn', 'drink', 'alcohol', 'particularly', 'eye', 'usually', 'last', '30', 'min', 'max', 'happen', 'iâ\x80\x99ve', 'apply', 'protopic', '48', 'hour', 'drinking', '\n\n', 'use', 'hydrocortisone', 'treat', 'eczema', 'year', 'half', 'ago', 'flare', 'start', 'occur', 'hydrocortisone', 'effective', 'doctor', 'tell', 'stop', 'completely', 'get', 'rebound', 'rash', 'eczema', 'stop', 'begin', 'hellish', 'year', 'life', 'bad', 'flare', 'iâ\x80\x99ve', 'experienced', 'couldnâ\x80\x99t', 'sleep', 'itchiness', 'area', 'ooze', 'didnâ\x80\x99t', 'want', 'leave', 'house', 'bad', 'feel', 'look', 'donâ\x80\x99t', 'know', 'experience', 'tsw', 'topical', 'steroid', 'withdrawal', 'eczema', 'worsen', 'removal', 'treatment', 'iâ\x80\x99ve', 'learn', 'stop', 'suddenly', 'instead', 'taper', 'horrible', 'idea', 'increase', 'chance', 'negative', 'effect', 'thank', 'doctor', 'lot', 'reluctance', 'eventually', '4', 'month', 'ago', 'give', 'dermatologist', 'agree', 'treatment', 'protopic', '\n', 'reluctant', 'possibility', 'go', 'tsw', 'tsw', 'facebook', 'group', 'read', 'thing', 'happen', 'protopic', '\n', 'donâ\x80\x99t', 'know', 'right', 'choice', 'long', 'term', 'time', 'tell', 'hydrocortisone', 'intermittently', '12', 'year', 'stop', 'work', 'huge', 'relief', 'month', 'obsess', 'skin', 'everyday', 'break']",0.178261,Deontic modality,Positive,Eczema,Burning,Skin-Related,Burning,Skin-Related

Protopic,WebMD,"In 2013 I was going through a painful divorce and developed horrible dermatitis on my jaw line and chin. My healthcare provider did not have a dermatologist on staff at the time, so I saw a GP at my doctor's office who didn't have a clue. I don't remember she prescribed but within minutes it felt like my face was on fire and it made my condition exponentially worse as it was all over my face. I looked like a monster or a meth head and it was seriously painful too. I live in the Boston area wherewe have no shortage of great medical centers, so I went to the ER at Brigham and Women's Hospital. After waiting two hours to be seen I didn't even see a doctor, apparently there were no doctors working, so I saw a nurse practitioner. I could tell she didn't have clue about my condition but prescribed something anyway. I tried it on a small area first, it did nothing. Finally my PCP got me an appointment to see a dermatologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, but I had to wait over a month to see him, and I looked like a monster. I saw an amazing doctor, so it was worth the wait. He gave me Protopic and I saw an improvement immediately within a few days it was gone. I still get occasional breakouts on my chin but with Protopic it goes away within hours. When I saw Dr. Stavert the following week it was all cleared. This is my last week here youâ??ll need to see someone else if you come back.

After 5 days without januvia my physical symptoms were better. No knee pain, no muscle pain, i stop feeling physically bad. One bad thing though from going cold turkey on the januvia is that i started to get depressed and could not sleep. I felt like I had drug withdrawls. could not sleep at all, worse than when I was on the drug. I guess the body gets used to having the drug in the system and goes in shock without it. i finally broke down and took one quarter tab just to have it in the system and feel better mentally. Once i took a quarter pill i felt a little better in the head. It seems to work so I wonder if a step approach is required in order to not have the system go into shock. I guess after months on the drug the system changes and you cant just flip it back on the drop of a dime. i will talk to my endo and see what they think is the best approach to get rid of the pill.

Januvia oral,WebMD,"i started on only metformin only. My doc did not like the H1C reading and so he decided to have me try Januvia. I had the usual stomach problems and it was ok. I decided to kick into high gear my exercise routine to 2.5 miles in the treadmill and 5 miles at night on the bike. I started a modified DASH diet. After 12 weeks in Januvia i started experiencing weird symptoms that I had never experiece. I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 6 years ago and was an lantus and step scale insulin. I was on lipitor on an off for six years and lisinopril. So i had never seen the weird symptoms before the Januvia. In the past 3 months i feel like i have been in a daze. Twice I went to emergency thinking I had heart problems. I would feel lathorgic during the day, i would get paranoid, had wild mood swings, elevated pulse, muscle pain, joint pain, problems sleeping, sensitivity to light and sound. It would get to the point that I could not be at a store that had bright lights because I would get dizzy and have vertigo. I decided to stop taking Januvia when I got pain in my left knee and started to have depression. My knee felt so bad that I had to quit my morning runs in the treadmill and the biking. Not good for someone who wants to loose weight. I started walking slowly again on the treadmill and then all of the sudden I pulled a calf muscle just from walking fast. I went to emergency thinking i tore a muscle, but it was only a pulled muscle. I stop taking januvia 3 days ago and have traded my morning run for a 5 to 6 mile bike ride and kept the evening bike ride also.

Januvia oral,WebMD,"My husband, age 71, was prescribed Januvia, 100 mg/day,in Dec 2007 in addition to the glipizide and metformin he was already taking. It did lower his BS somewhatâ??he saw more readings under 100 mg/dl and fewer over 220. On the downside, as the weeks went by, he was feeling more and more lethargic; had less energy; felt cold all the time, especially at night; experienced severe nocturnal leg cramping; had persistent, severe constipation which led to his abdomen being hard and distended; and his blood pressure began creeping up. He also noticed a loss of taste and smell, also of balance and stability. In other words, he was feeling pretty crummy. He lasted on Januvia less than three months, from 21 Dec 2007 to 2 March 2008 when he stopped taking it. Within a day or two of stopping the Januvia he began to feel like a new person. Januvia being the only new addition to his meds, it was the prime suspect. Generally, he is feeling much better, most of his adverse reactions having subsided; however his BP and BS levels are still higher than before Januvia which have him concerned that Januvia might have changed something, hopefully not permanently. He now gets BS readings routinely in the high 200s, whereas pre-Januvia he would have to enjoy a dish of ice cream or a big meal out to get those readings. It is as if the glipizide and metformin are no longert effective and, despite cutting way back on carbs and increasing the exercising, he is finding getting back into control is more difficult than ever.

Jardiance oral,WebMD,"Before Jardiance I was on 2x500mg metformin and my glucose was 155 and A1C was 7.1. My doc prescribed jardiance. After reading many reviews, I am concerned about the side effect that it could damage the kidney as I have stage 2 kidney disease so I made sure that my kidney doctor gave me prescriptions of blood test for general kidney functions (called comprehensive metabolic panel ) every 2 week and for a comprehensive kidney functions test (comprehensive metabolic panel and other tests) every3 month.
 
 After 2 weeks of taking 6mg of jardiance, my fasting glucose dropped to 95 (no A1C test) from 155. A decrease in eGFR of 2 points and an increase in creatinine of ~0.1. eGFR and creatinine fluctuate from blood test to blood tests by more than these values so more blood tests are required to see if there is any bad effect on these two tests due to jardiance. 
 
 As for side effects, I have not notice there is any, except losing about 5-7 lb and urinate more often because I am drinking more water to flash out the sugar which bypasses the kidney. 
 
 The price for 30 pills of 10 or 25mg of jardiance in US is about $500-$600. I bought 30x25mg from a Canada online pharmacy for $120 and cut it into 4 pieces so it costs about a dollar a day. It would cost me more to use medicare prescription drug plan.
 
 I estimate that 1000mg of metformin is probably reducing my A1C by ~0.5. On the internet, there is a plot of glucose vs A1C and 33 points of glucose corresponds to ~1 point of A1C. 
  
 Thus if I drop the 1000mg of metformin and keep the 6mg of jardiance, my glucose would probably be ~115 and A1C be ~6.5.","['jardiance', '2x500', 'mg', 'metformin', 'glucose', '155', 'a1c', '7.1', 'doc', 'prescribed', 'jardiance', 'read', ' ', 'review', 'concerned', 'effect', 'damage', 'kidney', 'stage', '2', 'kidney', 'disease', 'sure', 'kidney', 'doctor', 'give', 'prescription', ' ', 'blood', 'test', 'general', 'kidney', 'function', 'call', 'comprehensive', 'metabolic', 'panel', '2', 'week', 'comprehensive', 'kidney', 'function', ' ', 'test', 'comprehensive', 'metabolic', 'panel', 'test', 'every3', 'month', '\n\n', '2', 'week', 'take', '6', 'mg', 'jardiance', 'fast', 'glucose', 'drop', '95', 'a1c', 'test', '155', 'decrease', 'egfr', '2', 'point', 'increase', 'creatinine', '~0.1', 'egfr', 'creatinine', 'fluctuate', 'blood', 'test', 'blood', 'test', 'value', 'blood', 'test', 'require', 'bad', 'effect', 'test', 'jardiance', '\n\n', 'effect', 'notice', 'lose', '5', '7', 'lb', 'urinate', 'drink', 'water', 'flash', 'sugar', 'bypass', 'kidney', ' \n\n', 'price', '30', 'pill', '10', '25', 'mg', 'jardiance', '$', '500-$600', 'buy', '30x25', 'mg', 'canada', 'online', 'pharmacy', '$', '120', 'cut', '4', 'piece', 'cost', 'dollar', 'day', 'cost', 'use', 'medicare', 'prescription', 'drug', 'plan', '\n\n', 'estimate', '1000', 'mg', 'metformin', 'probably', 'reduce', 'a1c', '~0.5', 'internet', 'plot', 'glucose', 'vs', 'a1c', '33', 'point', 'glucose', 'correspond', '~1', 'point', 'a1c.', '\n \n', 'drop', '1000', 'mg', 'metformin', '6', 'mg', 'jardiance', 'glucose', 'probably', '~115', 'a1c', '~6.5']",0.115854,Deontic modality,Positive,Diabetes,Nil,Nil,Nil,Nil

Invokana oral,WebMD,"I highly suggest avoiding this medication if you possibly can. I was hospitalized for a week due to a poor reaction to this medication.

Took Invokana for a month in a half approx. by the time it happened. There was no other causes of my ketoacidosis. It did help lower my sugar though.

Based on my daily glucose readings, I'm not seeing any big improvements in my numbers, they have remained pretty much the same but the worst thing about this drug is the injection method. 
 For the last two injections I've experienced nothing but problems with the injectors, I have pushed the trigger and the button willnot go down. I'd hold that button down for several minutes and still nothing happened, no matter how much pressure I applied. Oh, I'd hear the first click but never the second. So when I'd remove the injector from my skin, I could see that no medicine had been released so I'd try again, and still nothing. The trigger would not go down. After the second try, after I'd removed it from the injection site and pushed the trigger the stupid thing would start to work and I'd lose the entire dose. What a piece of junk! I've tried with it being cold from the refrigerator and also letting it warm up a bit and still have been unsuccessful in getting a dose of medicine. Also, I do have to say those loud clicks are disturbing and startle me every time. I'll be so glad when I run through these doses, (if I ever manage to use them) so I can get back on Ozempic.","['having', 'ozempic', 'couple', 'year', 'force', 'use', 'truelicity', 'shortage', 'ozempic', 'marketplace', ' ', 'overly', 'impressed', 'product', ' ', 'base', 'daily', 'glucose', 'reading', 'see', 'big', 'improvement', 'number', 'remain', 'pretty', 'bad', 'thing', 'drug', 'injection', 'method', ' \n', 'injection', 'experience', 'problem', 'injector', 'push', 'trigger', 'button', 'willnot', ' ', 'hold', 'button', 'minute', 'happen', 'matter', 'pressure', 'apply', ' ', 'oh', 'hear', 'click', 'second', ' ', 'remove', 'injector', 'skin', 'medicine', 'release', 'try', ' ', 'trigger', ' ', 'second', 'try', 'remove', 'injection', 'site', 'push', 'trigger', 'stupid', 'thing', 'start', 'work', 'lose', 'entire', 'dose', ' ', 'piece', 'junk', ' ', 'try', 'cold', 'refrigerator', 'let', 'warm', 'bit', 'unsuccessful', 'get', 'dose', 'medicine', ' ', 'loud', 'click', 'disturb', 'startle', 'time', ' ', 'glad', 'run', 'dose', 'manage', 'use', 'ozempic']",0.174757,Deontic modality,Negative,Diabetes,Nil,Nil,Nil,Nil
Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"I'm type II. Started Trulicity in May 2023 with a A1C at 10.5, I was feeling terrible. Started using Freestyle Libra monitoring devise to see what was going on. Found out that my blood sugar was fluctuating as a non-diabetic but it was staying in the high range constantly and would get worse with fasting and early morning while sleeping. Started with .75 for first month and increased to 1.5mg. Just had A1c checked and is now at 6.2 after 3 months!

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"I started taking Trulicity when I was for certain diagnosis with diabetes 2 about 6 months ago. I have been pre-diabetic for about 15 years. Many controlled with diet and exercise. Recently I got into a really bad car accident so I was unable to control it with exercise and my diet went with it as well. Anyway, I was to start taking medication. I started with Metformin, which didnâ??t work for me and I couldnâ??t stay off the toilet. Then, I was given Trulicity. At first, I thought it was working great and I wasnâ??t visiting the bathroom so often. I started at 0.75 and I even started losing weight without trying. Probably because I felt really nauseous early on and then it turned into every once in a while. As the dose was increasing, I was visiting the bathroom less and less. In the beginning it wasnâ??t too worrisome. Then I noticed some stomach pains, as my dose amount was increasing. This was when my dose was at 3.0. I was having stomach pains followed by diarrhea. I spoke to the doctors and they said it was constipation and to take fiber supplements. So I did. I then started to notice my period had stopped. Now I thought it would be too soon for menopause, but I heard people can have it anytime so I thought maybe this is what is happening even though all of my periods have been normal up until this point. I was then finally increased to 4.5 This is when I wouldnâ??t have a bowel movement for about 4-5 days and even if I did, it wasnâ??t much. I started breakout with pimples on my face and body, which is not normal for me. My stomach pains now radiated to my back where I was laying in bed for two days. This always happened 2 days after taking my shot is what I started noticing. I was on my second month of not having my period. I couldnâ??t find anything stating that Trulicity interferes with your period so I just thought I was in early menopause. I was sad actually cause I wanted more children. When the stomach pains got so bad I finally reached my doctor and said I want to stop Trulicity to see if that was the issue. This is when I finally found out that Trulicity actually constipates you. I was never ever told this. So I thought that was the pain I was having was from constipation. This is when I read that it causes pancreatitis and kidney damage. I got lab work done and I had some signs of kidney damage from Trulicity. My levels were normal prior. I told them my period still has no come and they told me it wasnâ??t cause of Trulicity. So regardless I asked to stop the medication which they agreed. It has only been a week and a half since my last dose and my bowel movements are back to normal. I donâ??t have stomach pains beside some little radiating pains in my back, which could be from the kidney damage now. AND my periods have returned. This is the part I was surprised with. So Trulicity DOES AFFECT YOUR PERIODS! My main reason for writing this is to let others know if they are in my situation because I found absolutely NOTHING stating this. But it does make sense. Trulicity messes with your pancreas, which can mess with hormones, which can make with your period. Anything that messes with hormones can. I just wish I knew this before thinking I couldnâ??t have children anymore for the rest of my life. Which was very depressing honestly. Anyway, Trulicity might work for some people, but it did NOT work for me. My body was telling me it wasnâ??t the right medication for me, but I kept listening to my doctors who told me it was always something else. Even though it did bring my A1C levels down and I was able to finally prick my finger and read a blood sugar level of 100 which hadnâ??t happened in years, it was worth the pain and misery I felt during it. I now have to find another medication to try until I can get my weight under control or once I can get full mobility back in my right leg and foot so I can do normal workouts.

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"I thought this was managing my diabetes type two. It was managing my daily numbers about 40 points below what I would have been not taking it, and that wwas between 110 and 150. I have been taking Trulicity 18 months. I already have Gerd and acid reflux. Iâ??m on medicationâ??s for those conditions. I also have been on a blood thinner for many years due to having blood clots in my lungs. My stomach acid and eventual consistent stomach and digestive problems with severe acid, burning, pain, digestivecontractions, & slow digestion of my food, led to an upper G.I. bleed and a Mary Weiss tear in my digestive track. I was hospitalized for four days, as I all of a sudden woke up and was coughing up blood. I rushed to the emergency room and they immediately found the bleed and found a separate tear. I was seeing the Gastro doctor every month while on 4 different meds on and off for 6 mos. They were barely managing my symptoms. Although I had not thrown up blood after abt a week post hospital stay, I could not get rid of my stomach nor upper digestive track issues. My internal med dr. suggested that I stop taking Trulicity for two weeks. Thatâ??s two injections. The day I saw my doctor was the day I was supposed to take my next injection. He told me not to take it. I did not take it. I have NOT had ANY stomach issues since the day before I saw my doctor.

I am definitely not taking Trulicity any longer. I also am not going to take any drugs like Ozempic, or Mounjaro if it is filled by a compound pharmacy who can easily make the semagalatides into salt compound and that can be dangerous as well.

Lost a few pounds (20?) over the first two years, then plateaued (I had lost about 50 pounds on my own about a year before I started it). 
 
 I had the diarrhea side effect off and on for a year or so (probably my second year). Took me a while to figure it out because it would hit 2-3 days after dose. Usually only lasted for an hour or so (one trip to the bathroom). Funny thing - doc upped the dose to 3.5 and the side effect went away. Makes no sense to me, but I am happy about it. I have had none of the muscle pain, etc. others have mentioned. 
 
 I take it in conjunction with Jardiance, Toujeo, and metformin.

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"I was on lowest dose initially. Started feeling constipated & exhausted but didn't realize it was a Trulicity side affect. Had weight loss, but also was making better food choices and eating more meals. Major problem prior to med was I was only eating 1 meal a day. Dietitian gave me goal of 3 meals/day with 20-30 gms protein, each meal. It was hard for me but I wasn't helping metabolism with one meal a day. I've bern experiencing nausea and stomach pains, no matter what I eat. Totally exhausted, too. Still was not thinking it was due to Trulicuty. Was Increased to next dose. Next day while in p.t.'s waiting room, for neck issues, I started to experience severe shakes, lightheadedness, weakness in limbs and headache. I just didn't feel well. Again, did not connect it too thr med increase. Therapist monitored me, took b.p. & ckd vitals which were ok. Suggested I go downstÃ irs to see PCP, which I did. Vitals were ok, EKG was ok. Doc decided to order labs and a heart monitor, although cardiologist prior to all of this had done all kinds of tests due to a DÃ²c identifying AFIB at one visit. Heart is fine, since I never felt AFIB symptoms, I thought maybe the feeling I was experiencing in waiting room was AFIB. ??? I had all these symptoms the next day, too... shakiness, bad headache & weakness last night, 2nd day aftern dose & it dawned on me that I had just taken the new higher dose, the night before affects started.
 Anyway, now that it dawned on me that I increased the dose, maybe it is related to these episodes. Truly the symptoms made me feel awful. I texted my Doc in the portal about the very recent med increase, and I decided to search for side affects & found this site. To summarize, the symptoms I've had are extreme exhaustion, headaches, jitters, shakkness, weakness in limbs, lighthededness, firmer stools and just not feeling well. Feel next dose of this higher dose, will tell me a lot & I will attempt to update this review. PLEASE KEEP SHARING TO HELP OTHERS! THANKS TO OTHERS FOR YOUR REVIEWS.

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"I have been on Trulicity for 15 months now. I have a love-hate relationship with it.
 
 Due to severe side-effects and the fact that I responded to it so quickly, my dosage was never increased. My A1c had suddenly jumped to 8.6 after being in the high 6-low 7 range with the help of Metformin and Tradjenta for couple of years. 
 
 My A1c dropped quickly and my last one was 5.7. I have also lost 31 pounds which was much needed!
 
 Thatâ??s the love part. For me it works extremely well, even at the lowestdose.
 
 The hate part is the terrible side-effects. Apparently I am not â??most peopleâ?. While they are not as intense as they were initially, they are definitely still an issue. 
 
 I am keeping my fingers crossed. The past three weeks, though not without side-effects completely, have been the best I have had this far and hopefully the trend will continue!
 
 If so, my perseverance will have been paid off. Rather than switch to something which may have the same or even a worse effect and not been as effective, I made the decision to grab the beast by the horns and try to figure out and take note of what worked and what didnâ??t. For example, though it sounds counterproductive, keeping a little something in my stomach actually seems to help so for about three days I eat small meals supplemented with light snacks about every two hours.

I have never had any issues with constipation or bloating like that ever. I had to take something to make me have a bowel movement by day 6 cuz still hadnt went to the bathroom. Week 2 bad constipation again, smelly vomit burps and farts again, bloating and stomach lains continue, had to take something again to make me have a bowel movement. Week 3 started having small soft bowel movements every day and again smelly vomit burps and farts, atill bloated and stomach pains. Week 4 took the injection on Sunday again. Monday night started having diarrhea still bloated and stomach pains and vomit that was yellow and foamy. Tuesday felt like I was peeing out my butt cuz of the diarrhea being so runny. And this is several times an hour and a lot of it. Tuesday afternoon I realize I hadn't peed since about 12:30am. I was so dehydrated and nothing would stay in me. It ran right through me. Tuesday evening Went to the er to get fluids to hydrate me. 2 bags of fluids still couldn't go pee. Everything i was tested for was negative. I couldn't pee for about a total of 36 hrs. I didnt pee until Wednesday late morning. I get ahold of my doc she thinks it's just a stomach bug and not related to the meds. Knowing my body I knew it was the med. So I decided to try 1 more time. So Sunday rolls around I try it again. Tuesday diarrhea again, smelly vomit burps, bad stomach pains again can't sleep from it and super bloated again. Thursday and still having diarrhea. I'm done with this med. Terrible experience I don't recommend it at all to anybody.

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"I had been losing weight steadily for the last 18-20 months. I need a knee replacement (2, actually) but my surgeon said I had to lose another 10-15 lbs. I had already lost 60 lbs! I was 8 pounds away from my (first) goal weight when I started Trulicity at my dr.'s insistence. 
 He had been after me about my ""pre-diabetes"" for 3 years or more. I finally gave in because my A1C was high. 
 So I started Trulicity. In the 8 weeks since I started, I stalled in losing any weight the first 2-3 weeks.In the last 4 weeks I've GAINED 6-7 pounds! Now instead of being 8 pounds from my first goal weight, I'm back to 13/15 pounds away. This is the worst. If I don't get my BMI down my surgery for knee replacements will not happen. I am soooooo very pissed. 
 My Dr assured me that ""everyone loses weight on Trulicity, don't worry...""

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"My primary care doc says I'm not a typical type II patient, which is probably true. I'm male, 57 years old, not over weight and very active physically. Before trying Trulicity, I was on Metformin and Glipizide, plus a statin for cholesterol. During pandemic, became depressed and did not take good care of myself. Ended up with A1C above 10 as a result. But I was able to turn it around by radically sticking with diet and exercise that has worked wonders for me in the past. Thankfully, it worked again, getting the A1C back below 7 in about three months. 
 The higher A1C also got me a referral to an Endocrinologist. But by the time I saw her, I was back to good control. Never-the-less, she insisted that my best option was to go on Trulicity. I wish I hadn't.
 As described by a number of others here, the side affects were persistently horrendous. For some reason, I still stuck it out for five long weeks, during which I could never eat a meal without nausea, or finish appropriately sized and carb-counted meals. Yes, I lost weight, because I was basically in a state of medically induced starvation. (For me, not a good thing. I'm already quite thin.) In spite of losing 10 pounds, my blood glucose went UP an average of 20 - 30 points, and stayed there. 
 I'm pretty sure I can explain why this happened. Constantly fatigued, I was unable maintain my usual exercise regimen. I had neither the stamina nor the burst for vigorous exercise. Which is at the core of how I'veÂ successfully controlled blood sugar in the past. Trulicity took all that away, with predictable consequences. 
 I've had enough. I need to be an active participant in managing diabetes. And, bottom line, Trulicity made things worse, rather than better. All those quality-of-life issues, plus *less* effective blood sugar control.

Trulicity subcutaneous,WebMD,"My doctor put me on Trulicity in March, 2018 as an alternative to insulin. I had seen this advertised and willing to try it especially to lose some weight. The medicine worked great at lowering my levels and my A1c went from 10.5 to 8.5 in 3 months, so I appeared to be on the right track. I lost about 5 lbs in 2 weeks, but I was so sick 3 days out of 7 that was not a great feat. I complained to my doctor, who said this is a side affect and gave me pills to combat the nausea. That worked for about 3 weeks and after that nothing happened. The meds he gave me to combat nausea if what they prescribed to chemotherapy patients. By the time, I stopped taking Trulicity, I was so sick I could barely function. I took the shot on Wednesday morning and by Wednesday afternoon, I was sick until that following Monday. Needless to say, my doctor took me off. If he had not, I would have just stopped it myself. He put me on Januvia and I have never felt better. This medicine is dangerous.
